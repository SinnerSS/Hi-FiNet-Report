  abstract={Sensor networks have a lot of applications such as battlefield surveillance, environmental monitoring, and industrial diagnostics. Coverage is one of the most important performance metrics for sensor networks since it reflects how well a sensor field is monitored. In this paper, we introduce the maximum coverage deployment problem in wireless sensor networks and analyze the properties of the problem and its solution space. Random deployment is the simplest way to deploy sensor nodes but may cause unbalanced deployment and therefore, we need a more intelligent way for sensor deployment. We found that the phenotype space of the problem is a quotient space of the genotype space in a mathematical view. Based on this property, we propose an efficient genetic algorithm using a novel normalization method. A Monte Carlo method is adopted to design an efficient evaluation function, and its computation time is decreased without loss of solution quality using a method that starts from a small number of random samples and gradually increases the number for subsequent generations. The proposed genetic algorithms could be further improved by combining with a well-designed local search. The performance of the proposed genetic algorithm is shown by a comparative experimental study. When compared with random deployment and existing methods, our genetic algorithm was not only about twice faster, but also showed significant performance improvement in quality.},

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) consist of low power devices that are distributed in geographically isolated areas. Sensors are arranged in clusters. Each cluster defines a vital node which is known as a cluster head (CH). Each CH collects the sensed data from its sensor nodes to be transmitted to a base station (BS). Sensors have deployed with batteries that cannot be replaced. The energy consumption is an important concern for WSN. We propose an enhancement approach to reduce the energy consumption and extend the network lifetime. It hasbeen accomplished by augmenting the energy balancing in clusters among all sensor nodes to minimize the energy dissipation during network communications. The improved method isbased on a cluster head selection method. In addition, an enhanced schedule of the TDMA has beenimplemented. Finally, the development approach indicates the progress in terms of network lifetime, Number of cluster head, energy consumption and number of packets transferred to BS compared to LEACH and other related protocols. Mathematical analysis and MATLAB 2015a simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The energy consumption of WSN has been reduced up to about 60% and prolong the network life cycle by 73% than LEACH.}
